I. Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introducing a programming language as adaptable as it is innovative, the VYT
Language is engineered to provide developers with a wide array of programming
paradigms and fine-grained control. It is founded on the principle that
programming languages should offer flexibility, power, and adaptability.

Within the realm of VYT, you will discover a rich set of features:

  - Object-Oriented: Harness the power of object-oriented design to create
    modular and reusable code.
  - Prototype-Based: Embrace the elegance of prototype-based programming, enabling
    dynamic object creation and extension.
  - Type Safety: Write code confidently with a robust type system that identifies
    errors at compile-time.
  - Functional: Explore functional programming paradigms for concise and
    expressive solutions to complex problems.
  - Procedural: Craft efficient procedural code when straightforward solutions
    are required.
  - Low-Level Control: For those who demand peak performance, VYT offers precise
    control over memory management and resource optimization.

With VYT, your creative potential knows no bounds; it amplifies your capabilities.
As you embark on your programming journey, you will find a world of opportunities,
a supportive developer community, and a language that adapts to your unique
requirements.

Welcome to a new era of programming. Welcome to this innovative language.


II. Syntax
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the fundamental
rules and structure of the VYT Language. It defines how programs are organized,
how statements are constructed, and conventions for writing code.

 a) Comments:
    Comments play a pivotal role in programming languages as they provide
    descriptions or allow for the disabling of code segments. The VYT Language
    adopts the comment syntax used in most popular programming languages,
    supporting both single-line and multi-line comments.

    To create a single-line comment, simply use a double slash '//' in your code:

        // This is a single-line comment

    Single-line comments continue until the compiler encounters a new line
    character.

    Multi-line comments can span multiple lines and are initiated with a forward
    slash followed by an asterisk '/*' and concluded with an asterisk followed by
    a forward slash '*/':

        /* This is a multi-line comment
           spanning multiple lines! */

    Please note that nested comments are not supported as they may introduce
    ambiguity and will result in a syntax error:

        /* /* This is a nested comment */ */
